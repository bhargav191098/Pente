# Pente

The agent was developed as a part of the second homework of CSCI-561 : Foundations of Artificial Intelligence. 
Added the runner.py python file to simulate a gameplay with the agent. The user has infinite amount of time and the AI Agent has 100 seconds in total to make its move.
The Agent uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning to come up with a move.


Please run python3 runner.py to start a game with the agent :)
